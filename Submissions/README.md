# 📥 Submission Guidelines

Welcome to the submission section of the **30 Days Dev Challenge-Fundamentals**!

Please follow the instructions below to correctly submit your daily tasks. Proper submissions help us review your work efficiently and ensure fair scoring.

## 🧾 How to Submit

1. **Fork** this repository if you haven’t already.
2. Navigate to the `/submissions` folder.
3. Inside `/submissions`, **create a folder with your GitHub username** (if it doesn't already exist).
4. For each day, create a separate folder: `day1`, `day2`, ..., `day7`.
5. Place your code file(s) inside the corresponding day folder.
6. Optionally, include a `README.md` in each day folder to explain your approach (encouraged).
7. Once your changes are ready, **commit and push**, then **create a pull request** to submit your work.


## 📂 Folder Structure Example

```
/submissions
  └── your_github_username/
      ├── Task-1/
      │   ├── solution.py
      │   └── README.md (optional)
      ├── Task-2/
      │   ├── solution.cpp
      │   └── input.txt (if applicable)
      └── ...
```

> 🔁 You can use **any of the allowed languages**: Python, JavaScript, Java, C, or C++.

## 📝 Notes

* Only submit your own code. **No AI-generated code or plagiarism allowed.**
* Code must be submitted before the daily deadline to earn points.
* If you want to improve a past submission, you may update it — but only the **first valid submission before the deadline** will be scored.
* Include **comments** or a **README.md** if your solution needs clarification or uses a unique approach.
